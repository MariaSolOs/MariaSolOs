### Hola amigos 👋🏻

I'm a nerd, chocolate and wine lover, voracious reader and <s>slighly</s> sleep-deprived software engineer at Microsoft. 

When I'm not debugging mysterious code I didn't write, I'm generally binge-watching YouTube videos or Udemy courses to learn something new. I'm currently quite interested in game development with Unity.

Check out my portfolio [here](https://www.maria-sol-os.com/) or shoot me an email to majosolano99@gmail.com if you want to chat!
