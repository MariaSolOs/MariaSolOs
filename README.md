### Hola amigos 👋🏻

I'm a nerd, chocolate and wine lover, voracious reader and <s>slighly</s> sleep-deprived student at McGill University. 

When I'm not debugging multithreaded Java code, I'm generally binge-watching YouTube videos or Udemy courses to learn something new. I'm currently quite interested in game development and creating Electron apps.
