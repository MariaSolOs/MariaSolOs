### Hola amigos 👋🏻

I'm a software engineer at Microsoft, working on miscellaneous JavaScript/TypeScript tooling.

When I'm not debugging mysterious code I didn't write, I'm generally learning something new or giving my 2¢ to open source.

Check out my portfolio [here](https://www.maria-sol-os.com/) or shoot me an email to majosolano99@gmail.com if you want to chat!
